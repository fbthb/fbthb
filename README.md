Hi, this (@fbthb) is the archive of @florianbieser.

When creating the github account, I decided to use fbthb as username, which has my initials (FB) and the short form of "Technische Hochschule Bingen" (THB). Because my time at the THB will end in summer 2023, I've decided to change the username to my realname.
To make sure, that noone else uses the old name, and every project keeps accessible with the old url, I've created a new account with my old name and transfered the repositories.

fbthb/fbthb is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
